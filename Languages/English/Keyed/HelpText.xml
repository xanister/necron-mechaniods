  <!-- Bandwidth Gizmo Tip -->
  <BandwidthGizmoTip>An overseer can only oversee a cybernetica construct if there is enough bandwidth to do so. Each cybernetica construct consumes a different amount of bandwidth.\n\nGain more bandwidth by constructing band nodes and tuning the overseer to them, or by equipping special overseer apparel.</BandwidthGizmoTip>
  
  <!-- Alert descriptions -->
  <AlertMechLacksOverseer>Uncontrolled cybernetica constructs</AlertMechLacksOverseer>
  
  <AlertMechLacksOverseerDesc>One or more of your cybernetica constructs is not controlled. Connect your cybernetica constructs to an overseer with sufficient bandwidth to control them.\n\nIf left uncontrolled for more than a day, a cybernetica construct could go feral. When this happens they will join {0} and become hostile to you. If one cybernetica construct goes feral, it will bring other nearby cybernetica constructs with it.\n\nFeral cybernetica constructs cannot be resurrected at a gestator when killed.</AlertMechLacksOverseerDesc>

  <AlertMechLacksOverseerMayGoFeral>The following cybernetica constructs are uncontrolled and could go feral at any moment</AlertMechLacksOverseerMayGoFeral>
  
  <!-- Building descriptions -->
  <MechbandAntenna>Band nodes must be tuned to a specific overseer. This will add 1 bandwidth to that overseer's total bandwidth, allowing them to control more cybernetica constructs.\n\nOnce a band node is constructed, it can be quickly tuned to an overseer. However, retuning a band node to a different overseer takes significantly longer.</MechbandAntenna>
  
  <!-- Apparel descriptions -->
  <MechlinkBasic>A simple head-mounted comms computer that slightly enhances an overseer's control bandwidth. This allows them to control more cybernetica constructs.</MechlinkBasic>
  
  <MechlinkStandard>A head-mounted computer and signaling array that enhances an overseer's control bandwidth. This allows them to control more cybernetica constructs.</MechlinkStandard>
  
  <MechlinkAdvanced>An advanced head-mounted computer and signaling array that dramatically enhances an overseer's control bandwidth. This allows the wearer to control many more cybernetica constructs at once.</MechlinkAdvanced>
  
  <Apparel_MechlordHelmet>A heavy plasteel-weave helmet packed with overseer-assistance gear. The overseer helmet dramatically amplifies an overseer's bandwidth, but is somewhat less protective than dedicated heavy armor.</Apparel_MechlordHelmet>
