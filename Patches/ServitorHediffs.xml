      <description>A bionic implant that allows direct control of servitors through sacred binharic protocols. Servitor control links are used by tech-priests to control war servitors, and by overseers to control labor servitors. A person with a servitor control link is known as an overseer.\n\nServitor control links are self-installable. Pressed into the back of the throat, the unit injects itself through the flesh to clamp inside the base of the skull where it meets the spinal cord. There, it threads a web of ultrafine wires throughout nearby neuronal tissue to make the direct mental link between the user and the servitor control band.\n\nServitor control links are not simply devices for sending radio signals to servitors, because servitors are not merely robots. In addition to traditional computers, servitors have a dim psychic presence through their machine-spirits, so fluently controlling them requires a psychic connection. By linking overseer and servitor both psychically and electromagnetically, the control link permits deeper control than screen-and-button interfaces.\n\nSince the control link interlaces deep within the brain tissue, it can only be removed after death.\n\nNote: An overseer must be capable of smithing work to construct servitors.</description>
